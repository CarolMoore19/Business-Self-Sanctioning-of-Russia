### Abstract

Following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine on February 24, many countries have imposed severe financial and trade sanctions on Russia, including its access to global payments systems and the U.S. dollar, sovereign debt trading, commodity exports, and access to critical technology.  There is also an emerging phenomenon of “self-sanctioning”: multinational companies exiting the Russian market, whether partial or fully, temporarily, or permanently, despite not being explicitly forced to do so by sanctions. In this analysis, we estimate a Bayesian multinomial logistic regression model to identify the factors associated with a companies' decisions to curtail business with Russia, and to what extent.
